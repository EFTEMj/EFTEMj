	<h2>Drift Detection</h2>
	<p>The normalised crosscorrelation coefficient is used to detect the shift between the images of the stack.
	The <strong>reference slice</strong> is the image, all other images are compared to.</p>
	<p>For all possible shifts the correlation is calculated. The highest correlation indicates the detected drift</p>
	<p><strong>Set delta:</strong> It is possible to limit the shift for both axes. This reduces the computation time.</p>
	<p><strong>Perform image shift</strong> has to be selected to run the plugin <strong>Shift slices</strong> subsequently</p>
