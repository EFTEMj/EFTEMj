# Deprecated - use [m-entrup/EFTEMj] instead!

I decided to clean up EFTEMj before releasing it at an [update-site](http://sites.imagej.net/) for [ImageJ][ij]/[Fiji][fiji]. The result is the new repository [m-entrup/EFTEMj].

# EFTEMj

Processing of Energy Filtering TEM images with ImageJ (Fiji)

## What is EFTEMj?

EFTEMj is a plugin for [Fiji][fiji] that combines a drift correction and a flexible elemental mapping routine. It has been created in 2009 as a part of a diploma thesis. The current version is missing some elemental mapping features, but it is extended by tools for spacialy resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (SR-EELS). SR-EELS is the main subject of my PhD thesis.

## LICENSING

EFTEMj is distributed under a Simplified BSD License; for the full text of the license, see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/EFTEMj/EFTEMj/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Why do we use Fiji (ImageJ)?

[ImageJ][ij] is an open source image processing program and one can access the full source code. Further advantages of ImageJ are the support for a wide range of file formats, the easy to learn macro language and the possibility to write complex plugins with Java. [Fiji][fiji] is a package that contains ImageJ and lots of plugins. The main feature of Fiji is the [automatic update function][updater].

## Drift correction

Due to the specimen drift in a TEM it is necessary to apply a drift correction to the recorded images before creating an elemental map. The used drift correction is based on the calculation of the normalized cross-correlation coefficient. The implementation is based on the code published by [Wilhelm Burger and Mark J. Burge][1], but it is extended for parallel computing.

## Elemental mapping

An introduction to elemental mapping with Energy Filtering Transmission Electron Microscopy (EFTEM) is given by [Ferdinand Hofer and Othmar Leitner][2] (no longer available). EFTEMj uses the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) [Unser1987] to estimate the background signal, but is is possible to switch the least squares and Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm. Additionally, more than two images can be used to estimate the background, which results in a higher reliability [[Heil2012]].

## Spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (SR-EELS)

SR-EELS is a method that preserves spatial information when recording [EEL spectra][eels] [[Reimer1988]]. The SR-EELS plugins included in EFTEMj are used to correct distortions that occur when applying SR-EELS with an in-column imaging energy filter of a Zeiss Libra 200FE.

For more information you can have a look at my [presentation][slides] created with [impress.js][impress].
